This is a tool to visualize time spent by team members of a workplace on different projects during the year using d3js.

dm17.xlsx is the source file that has all the data that team members input through a google form.

crear_munequito_anual_porlabber.py has the code that we use to clean and transform the data to make it readable, and then save it as munequito_personal.tsv

index.html is the webpage where team members can visualize how they spent their time during the past year
